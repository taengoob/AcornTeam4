Driver Versions
---------------

These are the driver versions in the 21.6 release:

For complete documentation, please refer to "JDBC Developer's Guide
and Reference".


Contents Of This Release
------------------------

For all platforms:

  [ORACLE_HOME]/jdbc/lib contains:

  - ojdbc8.jar
    Classes for use with JDK8, JDK11, JDK12, JDK13, JDK14, and JDK15. 
    It contains the JDBC driver classes
    except classes for NLS support in Oracle Object and Collection
    types.

  - ojdbc8_g.jar
    Same as ojdbc8.jar except compiled with "javac -g" and contains
    tracing code.

  - ojdbc8dms.jar
    Same as ojdbc8.jar, except that it contains instrumentation to
    support DMS and limited java.util.logging calls.

  - ojdbc8dms_g.jar
    Same as ojdbc8_g.jar except that it contains instrumentation to
    support DMS.

  - ojdbc11.jar
    Classes for use with JDK11, JDK12, JDK13, JDK14, and JDK15 
    It contains the JDBC driver classes
    except classes for NLS support in Oracle Object and Collection
    types.

  - ojdbc11_g.jar
    Same as ojdbc11.jar except compiled with "javac -g" and contains
    tracing code.

  - ojdbc11dms.jar
    Same as ojdbc11.jar, except that it contains instrumentation to
    support DMS and limited java.util.logging calls.

  - ojdbc11dms_g.jar
    Same as ojdbc11_g.jar except that it contains instrumentation to
    support DMS.

  Note: The dms versions of the jar files are the same as
    standard jar files, except that they contain additional code
    to support Oracle Dynamic Monitoring Service. They contain a
    limited amount of tracing code. These can only be used
    when dms.jar is in the classpath. dms.jar is provided as part of
    Oracle Application Server releases. As a result the dms versions
    of the jar files can only be used in an Oracle Application Server
    environment.

  [ORACLE_HOME]/jdbc/doc/javadoc.tar contains the JDBC Javadoc
  for the public API of the public classes of Oracle JDBC. This
  JavaDoc is the primary reference for Oracle JDBC API extensions. The
  Oracle JDBC Development Guide contains high level discussion of
  Oracle extensions. The details are in this JavaDoc. The JavaDoc is
  every bit as authorative as the Dev Guide.

  [ORACLE_HOME]/jdbc/demo/demo.tar contains sample JDBC programs.

  [ORACLE_HOME]/jlib/orai18n.jar
    Contains NLS support classes in Oracle Object and Collection types.
    This jar file replaces the old nls_charset jar/zip files. In
    Oracle 10g R1 it was duplicated in [ORACLE_HOME]/jdbc/lib. We
    have removed the duplicate copy and you should now get it from
    its proper location.


For the Windows platform:

  [ORACLE_HOME]\bin directory contains ocijdbc19.dll and
  heteroxa19.dll, which are the libraries used by the JDBC OCI
  driver.

For non-Windows platforms:

  [ORACLE_HOME]/lib directory contains libocijdbc19.so,
  libocijdbc19_g.so, libheteroxa11.so and libheteroxa19_g.so, which
  are the shared libraries used by the JDBC OCI driver.


NLS Extension Jar File (for client-side only)
---------------------------------------------

The JDBC Server-side Internal Driver provides complete NLS support.
It does not require any NLS extension jar file.  Discussions in this
section only apply to the Oracle JDBC Thin and JDBC OCI drivers.

The basic jar files (ojdbc8.jar) contain all the
necessary classes to provide complete NLS support for:

  - Oracle Character sets for CHAR/VARCHAR/LONGVARCHAR/CLOB type data
    that is not retrieved or inserted as a data member of an Oracle
    Object or Collection type.

  - NLS support for CHAR/VARCHAR data members of Objects and
    Collections for a few commonly used character sets.  These
    character sets are:  US7ASCII, WE8DEC, WE8ISO8859P1, WE8MSWIN1252,
    AL32UTF8 and UTF8.

Users must include the NLS extension jar file
([ORACLE_HOME]/jlib/orai18n.jar) in their CLASSPATH if utilization of
other character sets in CHAR/VARCHAR data members of
Objects/Collections is desired.

The file orai18n.jar contains many important character-related files.
Most of these files are essential to globalization support.  Instead
of extracting only the character-set files your application uses, it
is safest to follow this three-step process: 1.  Unpack orai18n.jar
into a temporary directory.  2.  Delete the character-set files that
your application does not use.  Do not delete any territory, collation
sequence, or mapping files.  3.  Create a new orai18n.jar file from
the temporary directory and add the altered file to your CLASSPATH.
See the JDBC Developers Guide for more information.


Installation
------------

Please do not try to put multiple versions of the Oracle JDBC drivers
in your CLASSPATH.  The Oracle installer installs the JDBC Drivers in
the [ORACLE_HOME]/jdbc directory.


Setting Up Your Environment
---------------------------

In order to use the JDBC Thin Driver 21.5, please add ojdbc8.jar or
ojdbc11.jar to your CLASSPATH.

You may also add the following jars:
- orai18n.jar in order to get full NLS support;
- ucp.jar, ons.jar and simplefan.jar in case you usr RAC
- oraclepki.jar and osdt_cert.jar if you use Wallets
- xdb.jar if your use XMLType or SQLXML
- rsi.jar for ingesting high volume of data into Oracle database with high throughput


New Features in this Release (21c)
---------------------------------------------------------------

- Java Data Source for Sharded Databases Access: A new Java data source that enables 
  Java connectivity to a sharded database without the need for an application
  to furnish a sharding key.

- JDBC Reactive Extensions: A set of methods that extend the JDBC standard to 
  offer asynchronous database access.

- Java Library for Reactive Streams Ingestion: A Java library that provides support for 
  reactive streams ingestion, which enables customers to efficiently stream data 
  into Oracle Database. 

- Support for New JSON Data Type: A native JSON SQL type in the database. 
  The oracle.sql.json package provides functionality to work with the JSON type values. 

- Compatibility with Client Libraries Prior to Release 21c 

New Feature in This Patch Release (21.6.0.0.1)
---------------------------------------------------------------

The release 21.6.0.0.1 is a patched version on top of 21.6. 

OAUTH 2.0 authentication support specifically for Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) OAuth2 access tokens is added in this release. 

JDBC Thin drivers v21.6.0.0.1 can access Oracle Autonomous Database on Shared Exadata Infrastructure (ADB-S) using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) OAuth2 access tokens.  

Customers who want to leverage centrally managed authentication by Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) can use this feature to connect to Autonomous Database Shared using OAuth2 access tokens. 

Refer to Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with Autonomous Database for more details. 
(https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/manage-users-azure-ad.html#GUID-562655CA-4D8B-41D2-9165-6515BC824E07)
 
Note: Please note that there will not be any back-port requests supported on this release. This release is exclusively for making the OAuth2.0 Token authentication feature accessible.
